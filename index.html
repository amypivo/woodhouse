        <h1>Woodhouse</h1>

<p>An AMQP-based background worker system for Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 designed to make managing heterogenous tasks relatively easy.</p>

<p>The use case for Woodhouse is for reliable and sane performance in situations where jobs on a single queue may vary significantly
in length. The goal is to permit large numbers of quick jobs to be serviced even when many slow jobs are in the queue. A secondary
goal is to provide a sane way for jobs on a given queue to be given special priority or dispatched to a server more suited to them.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Woodhouse is currently being developed. It is not production-ready, and is liable to change significantly at any time. Caveat emptor.</p>

<p>Usage examples are forthcoming. Some configuration is required for Rails 2, but Rails 3 should work out of the box by just adding Woodhouse
to your Gemfile.</p>

<h2>Features (current)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Configurable worker sets per server</li>
<li>Configurable number of threads per worker</li>
<li>Segmenting a single queue among multiple workers based on job characteristics (using AMQP header exchanges)</li>
</ul><h2>Features (planned)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Live reconfiguration of workers -- add or remove workers across one or more nodes without restarting</li>
<li>Persistent configuration changes -- configuration changes saved to a data store and kept across deploys</li>
<li>Watchdog/status workers on every node</li>
<li>Web interface</li>
</ul><h2>To Do</h2>

<ul>
<li>Examples and guides</li>
<li>More documentation</li>
<li>Watchdog system</li>
</ul><h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Woodhouse originated in a substantially modified version of the Workling background worker system, and still retains some code
and structure from that project.</p>
