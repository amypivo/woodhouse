<p>An AMQP-based background worker system for Ruby designed to make managing heterogenous tasks relatively easy.</p>

<p>The use case for Woodhouse is for reliable and sane performance in situations where jobs on a single queue may vary significantly
in length. The goal is to permit large numbers of quick jobs to be serviced even when many slow jobs are in the queue. A secondary
goal is to provide a sane way for jobs on a given queue to be given special priority or dispatched to a server more suited to them.</p>

<p>Woodhouse 0.0.x is production-ready for Rails 2 and Ruby 1.8, while 0.1.x is in active development for Ruby 1.9.</p>

<p>Please look at the <a href="https://github.com/mboeh/woodhouse/wiki">wiki</a> for documentation.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Configurable worker sets per server</li>
<li>Configurable number of threads per worker</li>
<li>Segmenting a single queue among multiple workers based on job characteristics (using AMQP header exchanges)</li>
<li>Extension system</li>
<li>Progress reporting on jobs with the <code>progress</code> extension</li>
<li>New Relic background job reporting with the <code>new_relic</code> extension</li>
<li>Live status reporting with the <code>status</code> extension</li>
<li>Job dispatch and execution middleware stacks</li>
</ul><h2>Upcoming</h2>

<ul>
<li>Live reconfiguration of workers -- add or remove workers across one or more nodes without restarting</li>
<li>Persistent configuration changes -- configuration changes saved to a data store and kept across deploys</li>
<li>Web interface</li>
</ul><h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Woodhouse originated in a substantially modified version of the Workling background worker system, although all code has since
been replaced.</p>
