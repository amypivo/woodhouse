{"name":"Woodhouse","tagline":"An AMQP-based background worker system for Ruby.","body":"# Woodhouse\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/mboeh/woodhouse.png?branch=master\" alt=\"Build Status\" />](http://travis-ci.org/mboeh/woodhouse)\r\n\r\nAn AMQP-based background worker system for Ruby designed to make managing heterogenous tasks relatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe use case for Woodhouse is for reliable and sane performance in situations where jobs on a single queue may vary significantly\r\nin length. The goal is to permit large numbers of quick jobs to be serviced even when many slow jobs are in the queue. A secondary\r\ngoal is to provide a sane way for jobs on a given queue to be given special priority or dispatched to a server more suited to them.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse 0.0.x is production-ready for Rails 2 and Ruby 1.8, while 0.1.x is in active development for Ruby 1.9.\r\n\r\nPlease look at the [wiki](https://github.com/mboeh/woodhouse/wiki) for documentation.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Configurable worker sets per server\r\n* Configurable number of threads per worker\r\n* Segmenting a single queue among multiple workers based on job characteristics (using AMQP header exchanges)\r\n* Extension system\r\n* Progress reporting on jobs with the `progress` extension\r\n* New Relic background job reporting with the `new_relic` extension\r\n* Live status reporting with the `status` extension\r\n* Job dispatch and execution middleware stacks\r\n\r\n## Upcoming \r\n\r\n* Live reconfiguration of workers -- add or remove workers across one or more nodes without restarting\r\n* Persistent configuration changes -- configuration changes saved to a data store and kept across deploys\r\n* Web interface\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nWoodhouse originated in a substantially modified version of the Workling background worker system, although all code has since\r\nbeen replaced.\r\n\r\nThis library was developed for [CrowdCompass](http://crowdcompass.com) and was released as open source with their permission.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
