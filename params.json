{"body":"# Woodhouse\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/mboeh/woodhouse.png?branch=master\" alt=\"Build Status\" />](http://travis-ci.org/mboeh/woodhouse)\r\n\r\nAn AMQP-based background worker system for Ruby designed to make managing heterogenous tasks relatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe use case for Woodhouse is for reliable and sane performance in situations where jobs on a single queue may vary significantly\r\nin length. The goal is to permit large numbers of quick jobs to be serviced even when many slow jobs are in the queue. A secondary\r\ngoal is to provide a sane way for jobs on a given queue to be given special priority or dispatched to a server more suited to them.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse 0.0.x is production-ready for Rails 2 and Ruby 1.8, while 0.1.x is in active development for Ruby 1.9.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUsage examples are forthcoming. Some configuration is required for Rails 2, but Rails 3 should work out of the box by just adding Woodhouse\r\nto your Gemfile.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Configurable worker sets per server\r\n* Configurable number of threads per worker\r\n* Segmenting a single queue among multiple workers based on job characteristics (using AMQP header exchanges)\r\n* Progress reporting on jobs\r\n* Job dispatch and execution middleware stacks\r\n\r\n## Upcoming \r\n\r\n* Live reconfiguration of workers -- add or remove workers across one or more nodes without restarting\r\n* Persistent configuration changes -- configuration changes saved to a data store and kept across deploys\r\n* Watchdog/status workers on every node\r\n* Web interface\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n\r\n* Examples and guides\r\n* More documentation\r\n* Watchdog system\r\n\r\n## Supported Versions\r\n\r\n### woodhouse 0.1.x\r\n\r\n* bunny 0.9.x, RabbitMQ 2.x or later\r\n* ruby 1.9\r\n* MRI, JRuby, Rubinius 2\r\n\r\n### woodhouse 0.0.x\r\n\r\n* ruby 1.8\r\n* MRI, JRuby, Rubinius\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nWoodhouse originated in a substantially modified version of the Workling background worker system, and still retains some code\r\nand structure from that project.\r\n\r\nThis library was developed for [CrowdCompass](http://crowdcompass.com) and was released as open source with their permission.\r\n","name":"Woodhouse","tagline":"An AMQP-based background worker system for Ruby.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
